Just another monstrous repository

I'm Mudlabs Monster (a.k.a Sam Donald). I use to be a truck driver, metal fabricator, bar manager, and tyre retrieval expert. That last one just means I spent a bit of time pulling tyres out off flooded river systems. 

But all of that was going nowhere fast so I thought I'd come see what all this developer stuff was about. So far it's about being really confused for long periods of time, and then noticing you're missing a semicolon.

I like:
* Javascript, vanilla death to JQuery
* Ruby, thanks to Jason Seifer
* And I'm really interested in the possibilities of Nodebots. 

I hope to build (or be a part of building) some cool shit!
